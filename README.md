JavaScript Coding Practice Problems

This is a growing collection of javascript coding problems I have solved from Hackerrank.com and Codecademy.com to strength 
my understanding of solving problems with code. I do a few challanges every week to get better at practicing algorithms,
data structures, and js tools.
